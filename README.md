## Contributing - Frontend

- When working on a new feature/fix create a new branch from dev and work there.
- Clone the repo.
- Checkout to your branch with `git checkout nameofBranch`
- Run `npm install or yarn` then `npm run dev or yarn dev` launch the project
- Remember to update your branch from dev.
- While working, make frequent commits
- When you're done working on your feature make a PR only to the dev branch (not staging or main)

## Before committing

If you try committing and get an error from Git:

- Ensure you run `npm run lint` and fix all errors before trying to commit (husky will prevent you from committing otherwise).
- You can run `npm run lint:fix` to try to automatically fix the simpler errors.
- For easy formatting, you can use the vscode prettier extension to format code on save.
